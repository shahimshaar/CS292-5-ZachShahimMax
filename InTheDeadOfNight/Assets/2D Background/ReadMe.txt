>2D Background Assets
A collection of sprites and skies to build the backdrop of your 2D game!


>Getting started
To build your background you will want to use the sprites inside of the [Sprites] folder. Choose your background color from a sprite in the SkySpriteMap that suits your time of day and intended color scheme. If you don't find one you like you can colorize the gray sky.

After selecting your background color you can start pulling sprites out of the environment sprite maps 1-3. Use glow sprites to make a sun! Add clouds, mountains, and other assets to fill out the background. Change the color in the Sprite Renderer to fit your color scheme.

If you are looking for a quick background or inspiration use one of the prefabs inside of the folder [Prefab Skies] or open a scene from [Example Scenes].
